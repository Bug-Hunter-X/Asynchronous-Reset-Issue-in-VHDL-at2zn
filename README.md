This repository contains a demonstration of an uncommon bug in VHDL code related to asynchronous reset. The original code exhibits metastable behavior due to the direct use of the asynchronous reset signal in the process.  The solution demonstrates a proper method for synchronizing the reset signal to avoid this issue.  This is a crucial aspect of reliable VHDL design, often overlooked, leading to intermittent and hard-to-debug failures.
